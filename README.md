How would you verify a prime number?

 A prime number is only divisible by itself and 1. Run a while loop and increase by 1.
 
 How can this be made better?
 
The divisor can be increased 1 at a time. After 3 it can increase by 2. If a number is divisible by any even number, it will be divisible by 2.
